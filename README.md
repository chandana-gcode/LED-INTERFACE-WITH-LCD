# LED-INTERFACE-WITH-LCD
This project, "LED Interface with LCD," controls an RGB LED using an Arduino and displays the current LED color on an I2C LCD. The system cycles through red, green, and blue colors on the LED while updating the LCD display to show the active color. It combines visual feedback with interactive color control.
